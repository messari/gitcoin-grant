# Gitcoin Grant

## Goals

Messari is looking to build out a set of subgraphs for various DeFi metrics. This grant is specifically for building a subgraph for **Convex Finance** according to the following schema: https://github.com/messari/gitcoin-grant/blob/master/schema.graphql

## Details

We are interested in a set of standardized metrics around the protocol, queried using the subgraph, including:

- Pool information
- Usage information
- Revenue/Fees
- Transactions

The specific details can be found in the comments of the schema above.

For reference:

- Protocol documentation: https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/
- Smart contracts: https://github.com/convex-eth/platform
- Deployed addresses: https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/contract-addresses

## Submission Requirements

- Submission needs to strictly follow above schema
- Code needs to be easy to understand and well-documented
- All calculations (e.g. Revenue, TVL) need to be accurate
- Completed subgraph needs to index fully and sync to head

## Bounty

5000 USDC will be awarded to the winner
